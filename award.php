            In 2017, Schade24 took the initiative to give the reader a glimpse into the quality of the (injury) claim treatment by means 
            of the Schade24 Award. We hope this will improve our cooperation with the various parties and offer transparency
            within our profession.
            Since last year, we are not only involving the insurers in this Award,
            but also a number of involved personal injury agencies, with whom we have been involved in the process.
            Over the past year, we as Schade24 have worked hard on this assessment according to various criteria. <br>
            <br>

            Although there is generally a positive impression of confidence in insurers, according to CVS Consumenten Monitor, consumers gave insurers an average of just 6.1 in 2017 and 6.2 in 2018! The report that was recently published for 2019 shows that the insurers have remained stable on this point in the past year and have again achieved a 6.2. These figures therefore leave enough room for improvement; something that we at Schade24 would like to promote with the help of our annual Award. It is not without reason, however, that even MPs and the Dutch Association of Insurers state that the current system of personal injury compensation must be overhauled because, among other things, there is too little capacity at insurers to absorb the number of claims and to process them as quickly and correctly as possible.
            to treat. <br>
            <br>

            By means of our Award, we hope to make consumers - and insurers - aware of the quality of current claims handling, so that the victim's experience can be improved. We at Schade24 want to achieve this that, together with the claims handler, we can deprive the victim of confidence,
            so that he can fully focus on a successful recovery.
            <br>
            <br>
            As discussed above, for the Award we no longer only assess the insurers, 
            but also some involved personal injury agencies. Although most insurers and personal injury agencies
            have obtained a pass mark on average, there are also a few parties that still have room for
            improvement on various criteria. The accessibility of the practitioner and the speed of the
            treatment are points of criticism in particular, something that can still be worked on.
                For claims handling it is nice if a crucial party is easily accessible and communication runs smoothly.
            If the accessibility is moderate to poor and this subsequently influences the speed of the treatment,
            this is (in) directly noticeable for the victim and is therefore less able to focus on his recovery.
            To explain this point for improvement a bit more clearly, we use the following example: our client has been injured as a result of an accident. For the benefit of this client's recovery, it is important that he receives treatments from the physiotherapist. Unfortunately, the client is not very well off and these treatments provide him with a considerable cost item. The liable insurer is of course prepared to reimburse these costs, but has not yet given a formal agreement or has yet to pass the payment order on to the financial department. In another situation, the counterparty's practitioner may be extremely busy and cannot respond to this written request and cannot answer the phone due to busyness or absence. In such a case, difficult communication / accessibility or delay in claims handling can have many negative consequences for the client. The client then starts to worry about this and this is absolutely not conducive to his recovery. For this reason, this criterion will always remain a point of attention, but we hope that the relevant insurers,
                after becoming aware of this, will start working well on this.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, Het Waarborgfonds did not receive an award this year, but nevertheless we would like to do a shoutout to them. For many people this will be an unknown party, so we see all the more reason to put them in the (winter) sun. The Guarantee Fund is there for victims who have no information about the other party, the other party is an uninsured vehicle or if there is another specific reason for which the other party's insurer does not cover the damage. In these cases, the Guarantee Fund is happy to assist victims in uncertainty
            - of course under strict conditions - and thus pays great tribute to itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, before we announce the results of the Award for 20202 below, we would like to take a moment to reflect on some developments within the personal injury world. For example, did you know that……
            <br>
            the number of road accidents on the motorway increased by no less than 123% in 2018 compared to 2014? The biggest causes of this are overspeeding and distraction, in which the smartphone plays the leading role.<br>
            … Insurers demonstrated 12,879 cases in the previous year in which insurance fraud was committed? According to the figures, this is 12% more than in the year 2017.… it is absolutely a myth that most personal injury cases are fought in court? Various sources show that only 5% of damage cases end up in court.
